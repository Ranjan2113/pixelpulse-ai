# PixelPulse AI 🎬🤖

PixelPulse AI is an AI-powered content creation prototype that transforms a single idea into a complete **social media content pack** — including script, thumbnail, voiceover, and background music prompt — helping creators and small teams produce content faster with Generative AI.
